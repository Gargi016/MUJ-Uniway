## üìñ Project Overview

[cite_start]Navigating the expansive Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ) campus poses a significant challenge for new students, visitors, and even faculty[cite: 5]. [cite_start]**MUJ UniWay** is an interactive, web-based campus navigation platform built to solve this problem[cite: 16]. [cite_start]By providing a feature-rich, easy-to-use digital map, our project eliminates the frustration of finding specific destinations and enhances the overall campus experience for the entire university community[cite: 8]. [cite_start]This solution directly addresses the lack of a comprehensive digital tool for real-time navigation at MUJ[cite: 7].

## üó∫Ô∏è Our Journey: From a Simple Map to a Smart Navigator

This project was built iteratively, with each phase designed to solve a core challenge of on-campus navigation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 1: The Standard Map - An Imperfect Start</strong></summary>
<br>
Our initial prototype successfully rendered an interactive map of MUJ using Leaflet.js, displaying key buildings and locations. However, when we implemented a standard routing engine, it treated the campus like a public space, generating incorrect routes that ignored footpaths and internal roads.
<br><br>
üí° **Lesson Learned:** Standard routing tools are insufficient for private, complex environments like a university campus. A custom data-driven approach is necessary.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 2: The Smart Navigator - The Final, Robust Solution</strong></summary>
<br>
To solve the routing problem, we manually mapped the campus's true pathways‚Äîfootpaths, service roads, and shortcuts‚Äîinto a custom GeoJSON dataset. This allowed us to build a "Smart Path" system.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accurate Custom Paths:</strong> The map now displays the actual, walkable routes inside the campus, providing navigation guidance that is far more accurate than any public mapping service.</li>
  <li><strong>Instant Search & Highlighting:</strong> We added a live search that not only flies to the location but also places a distinct pointer on the exact building, providing immediate visual confirmation for the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Filtering & Info:</strong> Users can now filter locations by category (e.g., Academic, Dining) and view real-time information like operating hours, making the map a truly useful daily tool.</li>
</ul>
<br>
‚úÖ **The Result:** A reliable and intelligent navigation assistant that solves the core problem of getting around the MUJ campus efficiently.
</details>

## ‚ú® Key Features

- [cite_start]**Interactive Campus Map**: A high-performance, interactive map of the entire MUJ campus with detailed building outlines and location markers[cite: 21].
- [cite_start]**Live Search with Pointer**: Instantly search for any building by name; the map not only centers on the location but adds a special pointer for easy identification[cite: 22].
- **Accurate On-Campus Paths**: Displays all major footpaths and roads, providing a true representation of how to navigate within the campus.
- [cite_start]**Dynamic Category Filtering**: Filter locations by categories like "Academic," "Dining," and "Sports" to explore the campus thematically[cite: 24].
- [cite_start]**Real-time Information**: Click on any location to see its current status and operating hours in a clean, accessible info panel[cite: 25].
- [cite_start]**"Route from My Location"**: Instantly create a route from your current GPS location to any point on campus[cite: 23].

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

[cite_start]This project has significant potential for future growth[cite: 53]. Our implementation roadmap includes:
- **Guided Campus Tours**: Pre-defined walking tours ("Campus Highlights," "First-Year Essentials") for visitors and new students.
- **Augmented Reality Viewfinder**: An AR mode to overlay location information directly onto the live camera feed.
- **Class Schedule Integration**: Allowing students to connect their schedule for quick routing to their next class.
- **Indoor Mapping**: Extending the map to navigate inside complex buildings like the library and academic blocks.
